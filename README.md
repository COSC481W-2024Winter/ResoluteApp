# Resolute
A fitness tracking/logging application with social media aspects. The purpose of such an application is to encourage users and their friends to be involved in each other's fitness endeavors through non-intrusive mobile notifications.

The primary function of Resolute is to remind users to be physically active via notifications. These can come from the app itself, but will also come from other users such as contacts or friends. When a user completes a workout it will notify their contacts with a push-notification from Resolute of their achievement. The friend is prompted for a one-button auto-reply such as “Great work!” or “Impressive!”. This subtly encourages the user's friends to exercise alongside them, while adding motivation for the original user to keep at their exercises without requiring any more input besides logging their workout.

## The Team: Team Resolute

### Arie Gentry - Team Leader

I am a senior at EMU, formerly majored in Secondary Education Mathematics, but currently majoring in Computer Science. While I currently do not have any particular path I intend my life and career to go, I am utilizing my time at Eastern to try to open as many doors as I reasonably can. I am an optimist with my biggest flaw being my inability to define my limits, and sometimes pushing myself to take on an inhuman amount of work without regard to health or happiness. My coding experiences are all from EMU, so I have baseline experience with Java, Python, C, HTML5, Javascript, PHP, as well as SML and Lisp. This is my last semester at Eastern, and I look forward to working with everybody!

### Jonathan Taylor - Deputy Team Leader

A senior at Eastern Michigan, my degree is in Computer Science and I plan on graduating this semester. I'm interested in this project because my mobile development experience is limited and I've been looking to get some more practice. When I'm not at school or work I enjoy playing cards, reading, and scrolling through all the streaming apps trying to find something to watch. 

### Victoria Ceci - Team Member

I am a junior at EMU double majoring in Data Science and Political Science with plans to graduate in the winter of 2025. My career goal is to become a political analyist for an interest group or news network. My coding experience has all been through Eastern, so I have knowledge primarily in Java and Python. In my free time I enjoy reading, going to concerts, and hanging out with my cat.

### William Paddison - Team Member

I am a senior at EMU with a major in Computer Science I plan to graduate at the end of this semester in April. I am currently working in the service industry and have career goals of finding a career where I am able to work in a sales position where I can utilized my knowledge of computers to connect people with the technology either physical or digital that improves there life or business. I am super excited for this last semester, I really enjoy getting to know and working with new people :)
